# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
When I first examined this data, I had the goal of helping Louise, a playwright, analyze her crowdfunding campaign for her play called "Fever". She provided a data set with a range of crowdfunding campaigns in different industries with multiple fundraising goals. I first began looking at all of the parts of this data on crowdfunding campaigns. After learning that "Fever" almost hit it's fundraising goal relatively quickly, I changed my focus to help Louise examine how other crodfunding campaigns performed in regards to their launch dates and fundraising goals. In order to understand this relationship, I sorted, organized, and analyzed the data provided by Louise. After looking through all of the crowd funding campaigns, I narrowed my focus to examine the theater parent category in particular. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this report is to share my findings and thoughts about how the theater campaigns fared with various launch dates and goals. Hopefully, Louise will be able to better understand the success factors of a fundraising campaign as she moves forward with her other projects in the future. I had already examined the outcomes of the campaigns in relation to their launch date as I processed all of the data provided by Louise. In order to help Louise focus on the theater category, I had to filter my data to only show that category. 
## Analysis and Challenges
To conduct my analysis, I created a few visual representations of the data that helped me better process how the fundraising goal and the launch date relate to success, failure, or cancellation of the theather campaigns.

This first image shows how the theater campaigns performed based on the time of their launch. For the purpose of this analysis, I only focused on the successful, failed, and cancelled campaigns. 
I also wanted to explore how the goal amount affected the outcome of the campaign. To do this, I calculated the number of successful, failed, and canceled projects within a certain fundraising category: for example, less than $1000. I then found the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled projects in each funding range.

This image helped me interpret which fundraising goals had the most success/failure in the theater parent category. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
